/* Glossary:
 *
 * URB - uniform resource buffer.  A mid-sized buffer which is
 * partitioned between the fixed function units and used for passing
 * values (vertices, primitives, constants) between them.
 *
 * CURBE - constant URB entry.  An urb region (entry) used to hold
 * constant values which the fixed function units can be instructed to
 * preload into the GRF when spawning a thread.
 *
 * VUE - vertex URB entry.  An urb entry holding a vertex and usually
 * a vertex header.  The header contains control information and
 * things like primitive type, Begin/end flags and clip codes.
 *
 * PUE - primitive URB entry.  An urb entry produced by the setup (SF)
 * unit holding rasterization and interpolation parameters.
 *
 * GRF - general register file.  One of several register files
 * addressable by programmed threads.  The inputs (r0, payload, curbe,
 * urb) of the thread are preloaded to this area before the thread is
 * spawned.  The registers are individually 8 dwords wide and suitable
 * for general usage.  Registers holding thread input values are not
 * special and may be overwritten.
 *
 * MRF - message register file.  Threads communicate (and terminate)
 * by sending messages.  Message parameters are placed in contiguous
 * MRF registers.  All program output is via these messages.  URB
 * entries are populated by sending a message to the shared URB
 * function containing the new data, together with a control word,
 * often an unmodified copy of R0.
 *
 * R0 - GRF register 0.  Typically holds control information used when
 * sending messages to other threads.
 *
 * EU or GEN4 EU: The name of the programmable subsystem of the
 * i965 hardware.  Threads are executed by the EU, the registers
 * described above are part of the EU architecture.
 *
 * Fixed function units:
 *
 * CS - Command streamer.  Notional first unit, little software
 * interaction.  Holds the URB entries used for constant data, ie the
 * CURBEs.
 *
 * VF/VS - Vertex Fetch / Vertex Shader.  The fixed function part of
 * this unit is responsible for pulling vertices out of vertex buffers
 * in vram and injecting them into the processing pipe as VUEs.  If
 * enabled, it first passes them to a VS thread which is a good place
 * for the driver to implement any active vertex shader.
 *
 * HS - Hull Shader (Tessellation Control Shader)
 *
 * TE - Tessellation Engine (Tessellation Primitive Generation)
 *
 * DS - Domain Shader (Tessellation Evaluation Shader)
 *
 * GS - Geometry Shader.  This corresponds to a new DX10 concept.  If
 * enabled, incoming strips etc are passed to GS threads in individual
 * line/triangle/point units.  The GS thread may perform arbitary
 * computation and emit whatever primtives with whatever vertices it
 * chooses.  This makes GS an excellent place to implement GL's
 * unfilled polygon modes, though of course it is capable of much
 * more.  Additionally, GS is used to translate away primitives not
 * handled by latter units, including Quads and Lineloops.
 *
 * CS - Clipper.  Mesa's clipping algorithms are imported to run on
 * this unit.  The fixed function part performs cliptesting against
 * the 6 fixed clipplanes and makes descisions on whether or not the
 * incoming primitive needs to be passed to a thread for clipping.
 * User clip planes are handled via cooperation with the VS thread.
 *
 * SF - Strips Fans or Setup: Triangles are prepared for
 * rasterization.  Interpolation coefficients are calculated.
 * Flatshading and two-side lighting usually performed here.
 *
 * WM - Windower.  Interpolation of vertex attributes performed here.
 * Fragment shader implemented here.  SIMD aspects of EU taken full
 * advantage of, as pixels are processed in blocks of 16.
 *
 * CC - Color Calculator.  No EU threads associated with this unit.
 * Handles blending and (presumably) depth and stencil testing.

 * BRW_NEW_*_PROG_DATA and BRW_NEW_*_PROGRAM are similar, but distinct.
 *
 * BRW_NEW_*_PROGRAM relates to the gl_shader_program/gl_program structures.
 * When the currently bound shader program differs from the previous draw
 * call, these will be flagged.  They cover brw->{stage}_program and
 * ctx->{Stage}Program->_Current.
 *
 * BRW_NEW_*_PROG_DATA is flagged when the effective shaders change, from a
 * driver perspective.  Even if the same shader is bound at the API level,
 * we may need to switch between multiple versions of that shader to handle
 * changes in non-orthagonal state.
 *
 * Additionally, multiple shader programs may have identical vertex shaders
 * (for example), or compile down to the same code in the backend.  We combine
 * those into a single program cache entry.
 *
 * BRW_NEW_*_PROG_DATA occurs when switching program cache entries, which
 * covers the brw_*_prog_data structures, and brw->*.prog_offset.
