Intel Vulkan ToDo
=================

Missing Features:
 - FP64
 - Tessellation
 - Cull and Clip Distance
 - Sampler anisotropy (Is there anything to do here?)
 - Image Gather Extended
 - Storage Image Without Format
 - Investigate CTS failures on HSW
 - Pipeline statistics queries
 - Sparse memory
 - Per-sample-dispatch, minSampleShading

Code sharing with GL:
 - Add surface capability introspection to ISL (pull the surface format
   table from brw_surface_formats.c)
 - Generalize blorp to use ISL and be sharable between the two drivers

Performance:
 - HiZ (Nanley)
 - Fast color clears (after HiZ?)
 - Compressed multisample support
 - Renderbuffer compression (SKL+)
 - Pushing pieces of UBOs?
 - Enable guardband clipping
 - Remove alloc in renderpass begin to renderpass create
 - pma stall workaround
 - Use soft-pin to avoid relocations

Cleanups:
 - Drop libmesa.la
 - Deduplicate gen7 and gen8
