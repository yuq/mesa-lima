    *    Coherency with system memory in the state cache, like the texture

    *    Surface_State_Base_Addr are altered, the L1 state cache must be

    *    from system memory.

    *    This bit controls the invalidation of the L1 and L2 state caches
    *    at the top of the pipe i.e. at the parsing time.

    * Unfortunately, experimentation seems to indicate that state cache
    * invalidation through a PIPE_CONTROL does nothing whatsoever in
    * regards to surface state and binding tables.  In stead, it seems that
    * invalidating the texture cache is what is actually needed.
    *
    * XXX:  As far as we have been able to determine through
    * experimentation, shows that flush the texture cache appears to be
